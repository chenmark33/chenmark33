<h3> More About Me </h3> 

I am a recent graduate currently living in NY! I went to New York University, where I studied Mechanical Engineering student for a year and a half before switching tracks to a Computer Science major, with a minor in Chinese Language. 

Besides mostly growing up in <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013911.svg" width="15"/> New York, I spent 2 years living in <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3014/3014001.svg" width="15"/> Shanghai, China when I was younger, and have travelled to <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3014/3014018.svg" width="15"/> Japan, <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013903.svg" width="15"/> Switzerland, <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013920.svg" width="15"/> Italy, <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013894.svg" width="15"/> Mexico, and <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/206/206669.svg" width="15"/> Hong Kong. Future destinations on the top of my list include <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013991.svg" width="15"/> South Korea, <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/330/330483.svg" width="15"/> Taiwan, and the <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3013/3013972.svg" width="15"/> UK. 

When I'm not working on programming, I try to spend time between trying new foods, travelling, and learning new (spoken) languages. 
<!-- I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese, can understand Shanghainese, and have taken one semester of Korean, which I hope to continue improving in the future, at which point I'd also like to pick up German or Japanese.  -->
